  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: postgres-backup
            image: postgres:15-alpine
            command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - |
              pg_dump $DATABASE_URL | gzip > /backup/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql.gz
              # Cleanup old backups (keep last 7 days)
