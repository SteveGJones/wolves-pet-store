## Version History Summary

### Major Milestones
- **v1.0.0**: Complete authentication system and Kubernetes infrastructure
- **v0.1.0**: Initial Replit demo application

### Development Approach
This project follows a sprint-based development methodology:
- **Sprint 1**: Backend authentication and database infrastructure
- **Sprint 2**: Frontend integration and containerization  
- **Sprint 3**: Production hardening and final deployment

### Architecture Evolution
1. **Replit Demo** → **Cloud-Native Application**
2. **External Dependencies** → **Self-Contained System**
3. **Basic Auth** → **Production-Grade Security**
4. **Development Only** → **Production Ready**

## Breaking Changes

### v1.0.0
- **Authentication System**: Complete replacement of Replit OIDC authentication
- **User Schema**: Migration to UUID primary keys (requires database migration)
- **API Changes**: Updated authentication endpoints and session management
- **Environment Variables**: New required environment variables for session management

### Migration Guide v0.1.0 → v1.0.0

#### Database Migration
```bash
# Backup existing data
pg_dump $OLD_DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

# Update schema
npm run db:push

# Create admin user
npm run create-admin -- --email admin@company.com
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# New required variables
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Removed variables
# REPL_ID, REPLIT_DOMAINS, ISSUER_URL (no longer needed)
```

#### Code Changes
- All authentication now uses session-based system
- Admin checks use `req.user.isAdmin` instead of external user lookup
- User IDs are now UUIDs instead of external provider IDs
