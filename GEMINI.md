# Gemini Project Plan: Wolves Pet Store Decoupling

This document outlines the strategic plan for the Wolves Pet Store project. My primary goal is to assist in decoupling the application from all Replit-specific services and migrating it to a standard, production-ready, containerized environment running on Kubernetes.

## 1. Core Objective

The main objective is to make the application fully platform-agnostic, enabling a consistent and efficient development workflow that can be run entirely offline or on any standard cloud provider. This involves removing all dependencies on Replit and Neon.

## 2. The Plan of Record

To execute this project, we have adopted the detailed, agile, sprint-based plan outlined in:

**`plan/hybrid-sprint-plan.md`**

This is the **single source of truth** for the project's execution. It details the three-sprint approach, the division of labor between the two developers (Dev A: Application, Dev B: Infrastructure), and the specific tasks and integration points for each sprint.

## 3. Key Initiatives (as per the plan)

1.  **Authentication System Replacement:** The current Replit OIDC authentication will be replaced with a standard username/password system.

2.  **Database Migration:** The application will be migrated from the managed Neon database to a self-hosted PostgreSQL instance running in a Kubernetes `StatefulSet`.

3.  **Containerization and Orchestration:** The entire application will be containerized using a production-ready `Dockerfile`. The development and deployment workflow will be managed by **Skaffold** and **Kubernetes**.

## 4. My Role

My role is to act as an intelligent assistant to both developers, helping them execute the tasks outlined in the sprint plan. I will provide code, generate configurations, and answer questions, always aligning my contributions with the goals and architecture defined in the approved proposals and the official work plan.

## 5. Current Status: Ready for Sprint 1 (Dev B)

I am now ready to begin **Sprint 1** as **Dev B (Infrastructure Focus)**. My first action will be to re-read and confirm the following plans to ensure full alignment:

*   **Overall Sprint Plan:** `plan/hybrid-sprint-plan.md`
*   **Dev B's Sprint 1 Specific Plan:** `plan/Dev-B-sprint-1-plan.md`
*   **Testing Standards:** `plan/testing-standards-and-practices.md`

Once confirmed, I will proceed with the tasks outlined for Dev B in Sprint 1, starting with creating the Kubernetes manifests for PostgreSQL.
