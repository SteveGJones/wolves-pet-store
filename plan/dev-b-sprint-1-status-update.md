## Dev B Sprint 1 Status Update: Skaffold Configuration & Docker Build Issues

**Date:** 2025-06-28
**Author:** Gemini (Dev B)
**Status:** Blocked on Docker Build / Application Image - **Handover to Dev A/Senior Dev**

### 1. Progress Made (Dev B Sprint 1 Tasks Completed)

As per the `plan/hybrid-sprint-plan.md` and `plan/Dev-B-sprint-1-plan.md`, I have completed the following tasks for Dev B in Sprint 1:

*   **Day 1: PostgreSQL Kubernetes Manifests (Part 1)**
    *   Created `k8s/` directory.
    *   Created `k8s/namespace.yaml`.
    *   Created `k8s/postgres-configmap.yaml`.
    *   Created `k8s/postgres-secret.yaml` (with placeholders for base64 encoded values).
    *   Created `k8s/postgres-service.yaml`.

*   **Day 2: PostgreSQL Kubernetes Manifests (Part 2)**
    *   Created `k8s/postgres-statefulset.yaml`.

*   **Day 3: Database Migration Job**
    *   Created `k8s/db-migration-job.yaml`.

*   **Day 4: Basic Skaffold Configuration (Part 1)**
    *   Created initial `skaffold.yaml`.

*   **Day 5: Basic Skaffold Configuration (Part 2) - Partial**
    *   Refined `skaffold.yaml` by adding `profiles` section.
    *   Provided instructions for generating and updating `k8s/postgres-secret.yaml`.
    *   **Resolved `skaffold.yaml` parsing error** (with assistance from senior dev).
    *   Created a placeholder `Dockerfile` to unblock Skaffold build.
    *   Updated `Dockerfile` to include Node.js and `npm` for migration job.

### 2. Current Issues & Troubleshooting Attempts

I am currently blocked by issues related to the Docker image build and Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims.

#### **Issue 1: PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Warning**

```
pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims.
```

*   **Description:** The PostgreSQL StatefulSet is deployed, but the PersistentVolumeClaim is not binding immediately. While the PostgreSQL pod eventually starts, this indicates a potential issue with storage provisioning in the Kubernetes cluster. This needs to be resolved for reliable data persistence.
*   **Troubleshooting:** This is an infrastructure-level issue that often requires specific StorageClass configuration in the Kubernetes cluster. No direct action taken by Dev B yet, as the focus was on unblocking the migration job.

#### **Issue 2: Docker Build Failure - `esbuild` Syntax Error**

```
/app/node_modules/.bin/esbuild: line 1: syntax error: unexpected word (expecting ")")
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c npm run build" did not complete successfully: exit code: 2
```

*   **Description:** After updating the `Dockerfile` to include Node.js and `npm`, the `npm run build` command (which uses `esbuild`) fails during the Docker image build process. This suggests an incompatibility or issue with `esbuild` running within the Alpine-based Docker container.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Attempt 1:** Modified `Dockerfile` to temporarily install `esbuild` globally (`npm install -g esbuild`) before `npm run build`. This did not resolve the issue.

### 3. Current `skaffold.yaml` Content (Working for Parsing)

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta6
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: petstore

build:
  artifacts:
  - image: petstore
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

manifests:
  rawYaml:
  - k8s/namespace.yaml
  - k8s/postgres-configmap.yaml
  - k8s/postgres-secret.yaml
  - k8s/postgres-statefulset.yaml
  - k8s/postgres-service.yaml
  - k8s/db-migration-job.yaml

deploy:
  kubectl: {}

portForward:
- resourceType: service
  resourceName: postgres
  port: 5432
  localPort: 5432

profiles:
- name: dev
  manifests:
    rawYaml:
    - k8s/namespace.yaml
    - k8s/postgres-configmap.yaml
    - k8s/postgres-secret.yaml
    - k8s/postgres-statefulset.yaml
    - k8s/postgres-service.yaml
    - k8s/db-migration-job.yaml
  portForward:
  - resourceType: service
    resourceName: postgres
    port: 5432
    localPort: 5432
```

### 4. Current `Dockerfile` Content (Failing Build)

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm install -g esbuild # Temporarily install globally for testing
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine

RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S appuser -u 1001

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force

COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

RUN mkdir -p server && cp -r dist/public server/

COPY --from=builder /app/shared ./shared

RUN chown -R appuser:nodejs /app
USER appuser

ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 5000

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD [ "wget", "-q", "--spider", "http://localhost:5000/api/health" ]

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### 5. How to Recreate the Issue

1.  Ensure `k8s/postgres-secret.yaml` has base64 encoded values for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL`.
2.  Ensure a local Kubernetes cluster is running (e.g., Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled, Minikube).
3.  Run the following command in the project root:

    ```bash
    skaffold dev > skaffold_dev_log.txt 2>&1 &
    SKAFFOLD_PID=$! 
    (sleep 300 && kill $SKAFFOLD_PID) &
    echo "skaffold dev started with PID: $SKAFFOLD_PID. It will run for 5 minutes."
    ```
4.  After 5 minutes, inspect `skaffold_dev_log.txt` for the Docker build failure related to `esbuild`.

### 6. Next Steps / Handover

I have successfully set up the Kubernetes manifests for PostgreSQL and the migration job, and the `skaffold.yaml` is now parsing correctly. The current blocker is the Docker image build process, specifically the `esbuild` syntax error during `npm run build`.

This issue falls more within the application's build process and Node.js environment, which is typically Dev A's domain. Therefore, I am handing over the investigation and resolution of this Docker build issue to **Dev A** or a **Senior Developer**.

Once the Docker image can be successfully built, Dev B can resume testing the full deployment of the database and migration job, and then proceed with the remaining Sprint 1 tasks.
