# Dev B Support Summary - Skaffold Issues Resolution

**Date:** June 28, 2025  
**Supporting Developer:** Dev A  
**Issue:** esbuild architecture compatibility in Docker builds

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ESBuild Architecture Incompatibility
**Problem:** `/app/node_modules/.bin/esbuild: line 1: syntax error: unexpected word (expecting ")")`
- ESBuild binary was incompatible with linux/arm64 architecture in Docker container
- Native binaries often have platform-specific issues on Apple Silicon Macs

**Solution:**
- Replaced esbuild with a platform-agnostic build approach
- Created `scripts/build-server.js` to copy TypeScript files directly
- Moved `tsx` from devDependencies to dependencies for runtime TypeScript execution
- Updated npm scripts to use the new build approach

### 2. Vite Configuration Compatibility
**Problem:** `import.meta.dirname` not available in Node.js 20 Alpine image
- Newer Node.js API not available in Docker environment

**Solution:**
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use compatible `fileURLToPath` approach
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Missing Application Kubernetes Manifests
**Problem:** Skaffold configuration only included PostgreSQL resources, no app deployment

**Solution Created:**
- `k8s/app-deployment.yaml` - Application deployment with health checks
- `k8s/app-service.yaml` - Service to expose the application
- `k8s/app-secrets.yaml` - Secret for session management
- Updated `skaffold.yaml` to include all new manifests
- Added port forwarding for the application (port 5000)

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. **package.json**
   - Changed build script from esbuild to custom Node.js script
   - Updated start script to use tsx
   - Moved tsx to production dependencies

2. **Dockerfile**
   - Removed esbuild installation attempts
   - Updated to use npm start command

3. **vite.config.ts**
   - Replaced `import.meta.dirname` with `fileURLToPath` approach

4. **skaffold.yaml**
   - Added app manifests to both default and dev profiles
   - Added port forwarding for app service

5. **.dockerignore**
   - Optimized to reduce Docker context size
   - Removed unnecessary exclusions that prevented builds

### Created Files:
1. **scripts/build-server.js**
   - Simple file copy script for server TypeScript files
   - Avoids platform-specific binary issues

2. **tsconfig.server.json**
   - TypeScript configuration for server builds (can be removed if not using tsc)

3. **k8s/app-deployment.yaml**
   - Kubernetes deployment for the application
   - Includes health checks and resource limits

4. **k8s/app-service.yaml**
   - ClusterIP service for the application

5. **k8s/app-secrets.yaml**
   - Session secret for the application

## How to Run Skaffold Now

```bash
# Apply the namespace first (if not already done)
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

# Run Skaffold in dev mode with port forwarding
skaffold dev --port-forward

# The application will be available at:
# - http://localhost:5000 (application)
# - postgresql://localhost:5432 (database)
```

## Build Verification

The Docker build now completes successfully:
- Frontend assets build with Vite
- Server TypeScript files are copied as-is
- Runtime uses tsx for TypeScript execution
- No architecture-specific binaries involved

## Next Steps for Dev B

1. **Test the deployment:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n petstore
   kubectl logs -n petstore deployment/petstore-app
   ```

2. **Run database migrations:**
   - The db-migration-job should run automatically
   - Check status: `kubectl get jobs -n petstore`

3. **Verify application health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

4. **Consider production optimizations:**
   - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript for production (optional)
   - Use multi-stage builds more efficiently
   - Add horizontal pod autoscaling

## Technical Notes

- The solution prioritizes development velocity over production optimization
- Using tsx in production is acceptable for this demo but consider compiling for real production
- The session secret in k8s/app-secrets.yaml must be changed for production use
- Resource limits in deployment may need adjustment based on actual usage

## Summary

All Skaffold v4beta6 issues have been resolved. The build system now works cross-platform without architecture-specific dependencies. The complete Kubernetes development environment is ready for use with both database and application components properly configured.
